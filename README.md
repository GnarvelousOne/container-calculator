# container-calculator
Kivy / Python app that performs simple calculations for farm planning

Developed during my work at Square Roots Urban Growers.  The app helped us plan how many flats we needed to seed in order to guarantee we would have enough plants to fill a required number of flood trays for the maturity phase.  We used 162-cell 1020 flats to start the seeds, then transplanted those into 146-cell 2'x4' flood trays.  The app takes into account germination rates and does the math.  For example, if you know you want 27 flood trays of cilantro, and you suspect a 100% germination rate, the app will tell you to seed 25 flats in order to have enough plants.  If your germination rate is less than 100%, it will calculate how many more flats you'll need to make up for it.
